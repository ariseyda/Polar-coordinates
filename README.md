# Polar-coordinates
Define polar structure to work with points in two-dimensional plane. Define type for the structure. Properties of polar structure:  
- r stores real values distance of the point to origin.  
- a stores real valued angle of the point to origin, in unit of degrees, valid value range is [0.0, 360.0). 
Values out of the range are corrected to the range, i.e. 380.0 is corrected to 20.0 or 20.0 is corrected to 340.0.  Define following functions:  
- pprint prints a polar variable on console in form of (5.0/_30.0). 
- pscan prompts user to enter coordinates of polar point.  
- pmul computes multiplication of two polar and returns result  
- pdiv computes division of one polar to another.  
Test your function in a program that receives two points in polar from user, computes multiplication and division, and prints result on console in polar form.
